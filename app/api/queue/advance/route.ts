 * the room QR could curl-skip the current singer. It now requires the room's
 * screen token (`X-Boraoke-Screen`, minted by the /[room]/tv server page) OR a
 * valid host session. Rollout is flag-gated: `ADVANCE_AUTH=log` (default) only
 * records a would-block observation; `ADVANCE_AUTH=enforce` returns 401. Rooms
 * with no configured secret are not enforced (no-key → fail-open). A per-room
 * advance rate limit is the defense-in-depth backstop against a scraped token.
 * See lib/screen-token.ts for the full model + honest threat note.
