# cantai — Board

_Last updated: 2026-07-06 (WAVE 1 COMPLETE — 9 PRs merged; wave 2 building)_

## Needs user (TL)

- 🔴 GitHub Actions BILLING broken on paulosalvatore account — CI dies in 2s on every PR ("payments failed / spending limit"). GitHub → Settings → Billing & plans. Binding condition from PR #4 merge exception: first post-merge CI run on main must be verified green after fix.
- 🟡 Upstash Redis provisioning on the Vercel project (Marketplace → Storage) — unblocks TICKET-6 live path (dev proceeds with memory driver).
- 🟡 YouTube Data API v3 key → Vercel env — unblocks TICKET-8 live search. ⚠️ QUOTA REALITY (opus PR #8 finding, binding condition): default quota = 10,000 units/day and each search costs ~101 units → ~99 searches/day TOTAL across ALL venues; one modest bar night ≈ 80% of it. Before provisioning the key: file a YouTube quota-increase request (or accept day-one degraded fallback), and consider the filed follow-up (move search cache + rate limits onto Upstash so caching actually reduces burn).

## Follow-ups (filed by gates, unscheduled)

- Upstash-backed search cache + rate buckets (PR #8 opus rec — biggest quota lever; also makes rate limit cross-instance).
- Advance-guard for the double-advance race (ENDED vs skip; pre-existing, LOW).
- setQueue if-changed diff on /tv (render churn, LOW).
- POWERED_BY_FOOTER doc nit: env change needs redeploy on Vercel.
- Design-token consolidation (tv CSS module duplicates TICKET-4 tokens deliberately).

## Notes

- Branch protection on `main`: SKIPPED — GitHub Free + private repo (403); gates are process-enforced (D-011).
