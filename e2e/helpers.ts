/**
 * Shared e2e helpers (TICKET-45).
 *
 * WHY this file exists: TICKET-45 authorizes `POST /api/queue/advance` behind a
 * screen token (see lib/screen-token.ts). Every spec used to drain the queue via
 * a BARE `page.request.post("/api/queue/advance")`, which is exactly the call
 * the enforce mode rejects. Rather than scatter token-minting across specs, the
 * credential is obtained ONCE here and every drain/advance goes through
 * {@link advanceOnce} / {@link drainQueue}.
 *
 * HOW the credential is obtained: the e2e servers run in dev/test mode against
 * the memory store, where a room with no record (the legacy `default` room)
 * keys off the well-known dev-fallback host token (`DEV_FALLBACK_TOKEN`,
 * mirrored here as the specs already hardcode it — see host-controls.spec.ts).
 * We recompute the SAME HMAC the server mints in lib/screen-token.ts. This
 * mirrors the production reality that the token is derived, not stored — the
 * test just holds the same secret the venue's own TV page does.
 *
 * For a non-default room the caller passes the room's raw host code (the value
 * shown once at /new) so the helper can hash it into the room secret.

 * wiping any state seeded before that compile (the documented memory-driver
 * caveat; production uses durable Upstash). TICKET-44 made the authed admin
 * dashboard poll `/api/host/pending` and the patron page poll
 * `/api/queue/pending`, so ANY spec that seeds state and then opens those pages
 * triggers these compiles mid-test unless they were warmed first. host-controls
 * hit exactly this: the post-login pending poll compiled `/api/host/pending`,
 * the store reset, and the seeded queue vanished at the remove assertion.
 *
 * Call this from every spec's warmUp BEFORE seeding (alongside its existing
 * route warms). All calls are fire-to-compile — responses are irrelevant.
